**What is Velvet**

Velvet is one of the earliest yet still most popular de Bruijn graph-based algorithm based de novo genome assemblers especially designed for short read seuqncing technologies. Velvet takes in short read sequences (either single-end or paired-end) and produces high quality unique contigs.  Velvet also contains builtd-in error removals and scaffolding modules. Velvet is our default de novo assembler in the full VirAmp pipeline.

**What to input**

1. Here we require that you combine datasets of similar kind into one file and that you submit at most one single-end sequence file and one paired-end sequence file.  This means if you have the paired-end reads separated in two files (e.g. forward and reverse, as outputted by Illumina sequencers), you will need to combine them together into **one** interleaved file.  We provide a tool for this task under **UTILITY** section.

2. Please fill in one or more odd numbers as the k-mer size, separated by commas (no spaces), Each k-mer length should be less than 91.

3. Please indicate your dataset format: choose from FASTA or FASTQ

---------

**Expected Result**

A set of contigs is produced in FASTA format.  If multiple k-mers are provided, the results from several rounds (using different k-mer sizes) will be combined into one file.
